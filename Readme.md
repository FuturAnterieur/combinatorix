# What is this project

Game engine mostly for turn-based war games, with a game planned to be added to the same repo.

## The three levels of status/parameter changes

- 'intrinsics' : the values as they currently are 'naturally', before applying the current status effects
- 'locals' : the values as they are modified by status effects.
  (relatively new) rule : locals are always calculated from the latest intrinsics, not on top of other local changes as they are being applied by the status effects.
  Hence history_manager::get_active returns the latest currents, and not a snapshot of the locals as they are being applied.

  Actually locals are stacked and saved aside during status effects application;
  when we have gone through all these effects, we merge the resulting vector of status effects, taking priority and incremental changes into account.

  Maybe future TO-DO : currently only one CommitterId can be saved per resulting-change-at-timing, even when many incremental changes have been retained.

- 'currents' : the combination of latest intrinsics + current status effects applied to them.

Storage for these three things is managed with the same logic, through history_storage;
the history_manager keeps history_storage objects for status effect changes.

## Status effect modifications
It also keeps storage for status effects changes (i.e. lists of status effect entities).
Currently change recording for status effects is pretty bare-bones. 
It might need, in the future : 
  - a Diff type, using minimum-edit-distance between list of status effects
  - generalizing history_storage
  - maybe more things...


## Change editing 
Currently, intrinsic changes can be intercepted and modified before they are applied.
- Change edits are added to a temporary stack in the change edit history
- At the start, the original change (issued by the user) is placed on the stack.
- Only modification type that can be applied to Change objects is 'set', not 'incremental' 
- Changes can be banned through this mechanic.
- All change edits have a filter which decides if the change edit is added to the stack or not
- Then suppression type edits (i.e. bans) that are on the stack can have a filter that will be applied to each change in the stack, to determine if the ban 'catches' the edit or not.
- For a ban to suppress a change, the ban needs to have higher priority and a filter that catches the change.
- For now, bans cannot ban other bans.

# What is planned
## Client API
- Create separate APIs (all referring to game_logic) for status triggers, pre-change triggers, status effects, and the lambda passed to game_logic::run_simulation
- Offer capacity to edit triggers inside user callbacks mentioned just above

## Unit movement
- Support movement with...
  - many substeps of movement at each timing
  - checking for collision restraint colliders at each substep
  - checking for status-related colliders at least at each full timing... beware of stuff happening on the exact same timing though

## More triggers
- Event / Game action triggers
  - need to identify/codify game actions
  - still would have a filter function, timing delta, and action function

## User interaction during trigger functions
- Offer players choices during trigger execution (i.e. in trigger funcs)
- Basic scheme : 
  - game_logic trigger API has a request_info_from_player function
  - it pauses the thread which currently runs game_logic (i.e. a thread controlled by the engine class), probably using a condition variable mechanic
  - during this time, it sends a request to the player's client and waits for a response
  - then data is emplaced in game_logic via a common buffer
  - game_logic thread is restarted; execution resumes exactly where it had left off.

## Requirements checking
- Often, when actions are offered to a player, the server needs to inform him which actions are possible and which aren't.
- Some action requirements could rely on "X must happen in order to proceed with the rest of the action."
- In my case, X would probably, most of the time, be an intrinsic attribute change.
- So that means change-edits might prevent X from happening the way the action requires it to.
- But qu'Ã  cela ne tienne! We can run a "supposed change" on the change edits.
- Instead of committing the change with its edits and proceeding to a full simulation, just run
  the target entity's current pre-change triggers on a sample of the proposed change, and
  check if the resulting change still fulfills the requirement's criteria.
- this would limit such requirements to just say "I require change X and it has to retain such and such characteristic." It couldn't go further in a simulation, i.e. "also change X requires to trigger effects Y and Z". But this should be enough for most cases.
- offer a supposition-requirement API for the related functors.

## Change editing
- <<====>>> DONE <<<====>>> Add change ban filter feature (a std::function in engine::change_suppression_edit).
  - don't forget to merge the edits logically after that (i.e. only block changes that    are catched by the filters that have higher priorities than them).
- Incremental modifications to existing changes
- Implement change editing for local (i.e. status effect) changes. Should use the same structures/functions that change-editing-for-intinsics uses.
- Clean up the API (clients should not access change_edit_history directly).

## Status effect history
- See section above.
